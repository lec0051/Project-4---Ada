#### Summary
For this project, we created a program using Ada that had four sections: Initialization, Functions, Procedures, and Main.
In Section 1, I created an array of length 16 that could only hold binary numbers. To populate the array, I generated 16 random
0s and 1s using a for loop. In Section 2, I created a loop that took the binary array and returned an integer equilavent of that
binary value in my Bin_To_Int function. In my Int_To_Bin function, it accepts an integer value and returns a binary array that is 
equivalent to the integer value. In the Overload "+" function, I added two binary arrays and returned another binary array as a result. 
The other version of this function accepted a binary array and an integer and returned a binary array as a result. The Overload "-"
did the same thing except it subtracted the second parameter from the first. In Section 3, I created a function that accepts a binary
array and reverses it, and I also created another function that prints the binary array to the console. Lastly, in Section 4,
I called and implemented all of my other functions from above.
